## Initialization
The first command to run for a new configuration -- or after checking out an existing configuration from version control -- is terraform init, which initializes various local settings and data that will be used by subsequent commands.

Terraform uses a plugin based architecture to support the numerous infrastructure and service providers available. As of Terraform version 0.10.0, each "Provider" is its own encapsulated binary distributed separately from Terraform itself. The terraform init command will automatically download and install any Provider binary for the providers in use within the configuration, which in this case is just the aws provider.

The aws provider plugin is downloaded and installed in a subdirectory of the current working directory, along with various other book-keeping files.

The output specifies which version of the plugin was installed, and suggests specifying that version in configuration to ensure that running terraform init in future will install a compatible version. This step is not necessary for following the getting started guide, since this configuration will be discarded at the end.

his output shows the execution plan, describing which actions Terraform will take in order to change real infrastructure to match the configuration. The output format is similar to the diff format generated by tools such as Git. The output has a + next to aws_instance.example, meaning that Terraform will create this resource. Beneath that, it shows the attributes that will be set. When the value displayed is (known after apply), it means that the value won't be known until the resource is created.

If terraform apply failed with an error, read the error message and fix the error that occurred. At this stage, it is likely to be a syntax error in the configuration.

If the plan was created successfully, Terraform will now pause and wait for approval before proceeding. If anything in the plan seems incorrect or dangerous, it is safe to abort here with no changes made to your infrastructure. In this case the plan looks acceptable, so type yes at the confirmation prompt to proceed.

Terraform also wrote some data into the terraform.tfstate file. This state file is extremely important; it keeps track of the IDs of created resources so that Terraform knows what it is managing. This file must be saved and distributed to anyone who might run Terraform. 

You can inspect the current state using terraform show.

You can see that by creating our resource, we've also gathered a lot of information about it. These values can actually be referenced to configure other resources or outputs, which will be covered later in the getting started guide.
