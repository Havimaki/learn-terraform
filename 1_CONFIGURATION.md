## Configuration

The set of files used to describe infrastructure in Terraform is simply known as a Terraform configuration. We're going to write our first configuration now to launch a single AWS EC2 instance.

For our first milestone, we're going to create an EC2 instance that will act as the entry point to our backend service. This requires configuring the AMI to use for the instance. This instance will be placed in a VPC, and have its own security group.
